# dynamic-data-structure-linked-list
Create a linked list and reverse linked list

In this project, I created a linked list which is a dynamic data structure that links previous data to the next one. In addition,  I also created a code to reverse a linked list based on the node. For example:

if we were given linked list: 1->2->3->4->5
reversed with node 1: 5->4->3->2->1
reversed with node 2: 2->1->4->3->5
